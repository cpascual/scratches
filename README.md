scratches
=========

This repo contains small Scratch programs that I created for fun and experimentation.

Hint: you can upload an .sb2 files directly to the [online scratch editor](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/) and run them there.

Comet_simulation-manual
-----------------------

A simple scratch program to simulate a comet. It shows a comet (with 
tail) and the sun, and:

- the comet tail length diminishes with the distance to the sun
- the comet tail points away from the sun

The user can drag the comet around and see how the tail behaves


Comet_simulation
-----------------

Similar to above `Comet_simulation-manual`, but the comet orbits on its own 
(instead of being dragged with the mouse) and follows an orbit dictated by 
a force inverse to the square of the distance to the sun

Oso (bear)
----------

A game in which you help a bear catch falling apples by moving the bear with the left/right arrows.

CotxeRobot (Robot car)
----------------------

A game to teach basic programming: program the actions of a car to help it get to the finish line without hitting obstacles or running out of the road.
You can use 4 basic custom blocks already provided: `Advance`, `turn right`, `turn left` and `jump`. There are 6 levels in increasing difficulty order.

The UI is very crude. You must ensure clicking on the green flag before running your "program"

Parabollic_Shoot
----------------

An interactive parabolic shoot simulator. Use the mouse to set the initial speed and angle of a ball and shoot it (pressing the space key). 
The ball will follow a trajectory that depends on its inital speed and the simulated gravity force (the "g" constant can be altered interactively). 
The ball coordinates and velocity components are displayed in real time.
