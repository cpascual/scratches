scratches
=========

This repo contains small Scratch programs that I created for fun and experimentation.

Hint: you can upload an .sb2 file directly to the [online scratch editor](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/) and run it there.

Comet_simulation
----------------

A simple scratch program to simulate a comet. It shows a comet (with 
tail) and the sun, and:

- the comet orbit results from a force inverse to the square of the
  distance to the sun
- the comet tail length diminishes with the distance to the sun
- the comet tail points away from the sun
